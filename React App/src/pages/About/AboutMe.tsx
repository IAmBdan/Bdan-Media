            My name is Brian Daniels. I am a photographer and videographer with
            a love for capturing moments from all aspects of life. I might be
            the most spontaneous guy you know, and it continues to foster
            experiences I never thought possible. I currently attend
            Northeastern University, working toward my degree in Computer
            Science.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            My journey started when I was studying abroad. I began taking
            photos with a drone and my phone, and with the support of my
            friends, I honed my skills. Since returning, Iâ€™ve taken every
            opportunity to grow. Sleepless nights, travel, and determination
            have shaped me into who I am today.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I thrive on the thrill of meeting new people, exploring new places,
            and saying yes to every opportunity. This mindset drives my
            success, and I love every moment of it.
